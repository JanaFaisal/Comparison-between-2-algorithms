Why do you need to study algorithms? If you are going to be a computer professional, there are both practical and theoretical reasons to study algorithms.
From a practical standpoint, you have to know a standard set of important algorithms from different areas of computing; in addition, 
you should be able to design new algorithms and analyze their efficiency.
From the theoretical standpoint, the study of algorithms, sometimes called algorithmics, has come to be recognized as the cornerstone of computer science.
David Harel, in his delightful book pointedly titled Algorithmics:
the Spirit of Computing, put it as follows:
Algorithmics is more than a branch of computer science. It is the core of computer science, and, in all fairness, can be said to be relevant to most of science, business, and technology. [Har92, p. 6]
But even if you are not a student in a computing-related program,
there are compelling reasons to study algorithms. To put it bluntly, computer programs would not exist without algorithms.
And with computer applications becoming indispensable in almost all aspects of our professional and personal lives,
studying algorithms becomes a necessity for more and more people.
